# YOUTUBE-VIDEO-SUMMARIZER

With the amount of content on YouTube ever increasing, extracting significant insights from videos in the 
shortest possible time has been one of the biggest problems. The YouTube Video Summarizer project will, 
therefore, aim to cut a version of video transcripts in a summarized manner that could be browsed without 
the presence of distractions to increase user experience.

 A video transcription is done using advanced 
technologies such as YouTube-DLP for video extraction

MoviePy for audio processing

OpenAI's 
Whisper for audio-to-text transcription.

This transcription of the video content is summarized using a 
Transformer-based model by retaining only the necessary points to save users' time
